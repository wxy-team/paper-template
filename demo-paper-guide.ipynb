    "    - Are abstract headings appropriate for the type of research?\n",
    "    - Are they those required for the journal to which you are submitting: for example, background or context, objectives or aims, methods or design, results or outcome, and conclusions or discussion?\n",
    "3. Check the maximum number of words.\n",
    "4. Check whether the abstract makes sense and that you are getting your message across. Ask a colleague who is not involved in the research to read it. Do they understand your message?\n",
    "5. Check for consistency. The abstract should reflect the paper and describe your message succinctly and accurately. As soon as the paper is written, compare the abstract with the paper. Do the objectives described in the abstract match those in the paper? New words that change the emphasis can appear in the process of pruning e.g. appropriateness is not the same as suitability or usability.\n"
